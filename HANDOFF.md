# Statify, Session Handoff and Ground Rules

> Read this file in full at the start of every working session, before opening any other file.
> Update Section 2 at the end of every session.

## 1. Ground Rules (immutable; do not modify without explicit approval from Aykhan)

**R1. Authorship.** No external tool, model, or product name appears anywhere in this repository: not in commits, not in code comments, not in documentation, not in PR descriptions, not in commit co-authors, not in this file. All work is authored by the four team members listed in Section 4.

**R2. Commit attribution.** Every commit must be authored by exactly one of the four team members. Use `scripts/commit-as.sh <person-key> [git commit args...]` for every commit. Do not run `git commit` directly. Distribute commits across team members per the "Commit author" column in `CHECKLIST.md`.

**R3. Folder structure.** The repository layout is defined in `docs/adr/0001-tech-stack-and-foundation.md` Sections 3.1 and 3.5. Do not create new top-level folders or rename existing ones without (a) recording the change in Section 3 of this file and (b) opening a new ADR.

**R4. Decisions.** Any architectural decision (library choice, pattern adoption, schema change) gets a new ADR in `docs/adr/`. Number sequentially. Do not bury decisions in code comments, PR descriptions, or this file.

**R5. State updates.** At the end of every working session: update Section 2 of this file, tick completed items in `CHECKLIST.md`, and write any mid-flight work into "Open threads" so the next session resumes cleanly.

**R6. No invention.** Do not create files, endpoints, schemas, or features not already listed in `CHECKLIST.md`. If a need arises, add it to the checklist first, get Aykhan's approval, then build.

**R7. Destructive actions.** Confirm with Aykhan before: force push, hard reset, history rewrite, branch deletion, mass rename, dropping tables, dropping migrations. Never run these on `main` or `dev`.

**R8. Style.** All docs in impersonal voice. No emoji unless explicitly requested. No em dashes; use regular hyphens. Plain Markdown.

**R9. Verification.** "Done" requires the relevant verification to pass: lint, typecheck, tests, and a manual smoke test for UI changes. State exactly what was verified.

**R10. Scope discipline.** If asked for X, do X. Do not opportunistically refactor Y. Add cleanups to `CHECKLIST.md` and run them as separate tasks.

## 2. Current State

**Updated:** 2026-05-22

- **Last completed:** Phase 3 (Scaffolding). Repo initialized, all packages and apps scaffolded, lint/typecheck/format/build all green, pushed to https://github.com/aykhan019/statify.git with branch protection on `main` and `dev`.
- **Currently in progress:** none. Awaiting Aykhan's greenlight to begin Phase 4 F1.
- **Next concrete action:** Phase 4 F1 (Config and Logging foundation). Builds on the ConfigModule and LoggerModule stubs already in `apps/api/src/`. See `CHECKLIST.md` Phase 4 section.
- **Open files/components:** none.
- **Open decisions:** none blocking.
- **Open threads:** none.
- **Watch list:**
  1. Verify commit attribution on GitHub for all four identities after the first push; if Elshad's or Rahila's `@ku.edu.tr`-authored commits do not link to their profiles, the email must be added at https://github.com/settings/emails on each account.
  2. Neon free tier is 0.5 GB; re-verify headroom after the first MPD ingest dry run.
  3. Render free service spins down after 15 min idle; set up cron-job.org warm ping after the first deploy.

## 3. Structural Changes Log

| Date       | Change                      | ADR     | By     |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| 2026-05-22 | Initial repo layout defined | ADR-001 | Aykhan |

(Append a row whenever the folder structure or repo layout changes.)

## 4. Team Identities

| Key      | Name              | Commit email            | GitHub      |
| -------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- |
| `aykhan` | Aykhan Ahmadzada  | ayxanx17@gmail.com      | aykhan019   |
| `elshad` | Elshad Toklayev   | etoklayev23@ku.edu.tr   | endorphin13 |
| `rahila` | Rahila Dashdiyeva | rdashdiyeva23@ku.edu.tr | Rahila2707  |
| `eljan`  | Eljan Mammadli    | eljanmammadli@gmail.com | EljanM      |

Each member must have the email above on their GitHub account at https://github.com/settings/emails for commits to attribute correctly. Elshad and Rahila are reported to have created their GitHub accounts using their `@ku.edu.tr` addresses; verify after first push.

## 5. Documents Map

The canonical inventory. If a doc is not here, it should not exist.

**Living (updated frequently):**

- `HANDOFF.md` (this file), ground rules and current state.
- `CHECKLIST.md`, full task list with ownership and effort.

**Operational:**

- `README.md`, project overview and quickstart.
- `docs/onboarding.md`, clone-to-running in under 15 minutes. (TBD in Phase 4.)
- `docs/architecture.md`, narrative architecture summary with links to ADRs. (TBD in Phase 4.)
- `docs/api.md`, REST surface. (Generated from Swagger in Phase 4.)
- `docs/runbook.md`, recovery procedures. (TBD in Phase 4.)
- `docs/erd.dbml` and `docs/erd.png`, schema diagram. (TBD in Phase 4.)

**Decisions (append only):**

- `docs/adr/0001-tech-stack-and-foundation.md`
- `docs/adr/000N-...` future ADRs.

**Submission artifacts (built over the project):**

- `report/final-report.md`, academic write-up, exported to PDF for submission.
- `report/sql-queries.md`, the six advanced SQL queries with sample I/O.
- `report/demo-script.md`, exact click-by-click demo walkthrough.
- `report/erd-explanation.md`, ER model writeup for the rubric.
- `report/slides.md` or Google Slides link, in-class presentation.

**Repo hygiene:**

- `.github/pull_request_template.md`, `CODEOWNERS`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE`, `.env.example`.
